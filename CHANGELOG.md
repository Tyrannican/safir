# Change Log

Documenting changes between versions beginning from v0.3.0

## v0.3.0

No breaking changes, just an update of the backend used for file creation and maintenance.
Due to this allowing more extended work going forward, bumped up to v0.3.0

* Changed backend file handling to use the [Rubin](https://crates.io/crates/rubin) crates instead of a custom solution
