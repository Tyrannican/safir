# Change Log 

Documenting changes between versions 

## v0.3.0

Removed formatted output

This makes more sense in the for safir-mem as it means you can easily evaluate output in the terminal

Better suits the use case.

## v0.2.1

Changes to the internal code structure, no changes to operation

## v0.2.0

Moved the core of the control to a new internal library called `safir-core`

No changes to operation but merits a version bump
