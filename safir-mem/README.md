# Safir-mem

## Notice

:warning: This is now archived and no longer updated :warning:

It was ambitious (and worked kinda) but became far too unweildy and complicated when it didn't have to.
Maybe a rewrite in the future but for now, it's now archived.

Simple in-memory CLI key/value store.

The in-memory version of [Safir](https://crates.io/crates/safir)!

`safir-mem` starts a service which runs on `localhost` or `127.0.0.1` on dedicated port `9876`.

This can be enabled / diabled with the `start` and `stop` commands respectively.
Note that when the memcache service is disabled, ALL data contained within it is lost so use wisely.

In cases where you want to save the contents of the memcache, the `dump` command will allow for the contents to be saved out to disk in JSON format.
This behaves as a snapshot as the contents of the cache persist after usage.

## Install

To install `safir-mem`, run `cargo install safir-mem`.

### Requirements

Using this requires that the [Rubin CLI](https://crates.io/crates/rubin-cli) be installed.

```bash
cargo install rubin-cli
```
