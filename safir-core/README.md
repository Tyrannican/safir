# Safir Core

## Notice

:warning: This is now archived and no longer updated :warning:

It was ambitious (and worked kinda) but became far too unweildy and complicated when it didn't have to.
Maybe a rewrite in the future but for now, it's now archived.

Internal library used by `safir` and `safir-mem` found [here](https://github.com/Tyrannican/safir)

Not intended for public use unless you want to contribute!
